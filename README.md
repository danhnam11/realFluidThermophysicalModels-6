# A real-fluid based thermophysicalModels library OF-6
## General Information
An updated _thermophysicalModels_ libary of OpenFOAM 6.0. with real-fluid models for reacting flow simulations at high pressure. Readers are referred to documentations provided in _documentations_ directory for the detail implementation and extension guide. They are written for the development in OpenFOAM-6 but they can be referred for the development in other versions.
For OpenFOAM-8, see this repository: https://github.com/danhnam11/realFluidThermophysicalModels-8
## List of implemented real-fluid models in the new libary
- Modified Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) model for equation of state [1, 2].
- Peng-Robinson (PR) model for equation of state [3]
- JANAF-based model for real-fluid thermodynamic properties.
- Chung's model (1988) for dynamic viscosity and thermal conductivity [4].
- Mixture averaged model for mass diffusivity of individual species in a mixture in which the binary diffusion coefficients are based on Fuller's model and Takahashi correction at high pressure [5].
- Mixture averaged model for mass diffusivity of individual species in a mixture in which the binary diffusion coefficients are based on Standard Kinetic Theory [6].
## Combinations of implemented models available in the library
The runtime names of thermophysical models need to be specified correctly in the _thermoType_ dictionary and _chemistryType_ dictionary based on the combinations of implemented models available in the libary. For example:

In the _constant/thermophysicalProperties_ file: 

	thermoType
	{
		type            hePsiThermo;                   //(1)
		mixture         SRKchungTakaReactingMixture;   //(2)
		transport       chungTaka;                     //(3)
		thermo          rfJanaf;                       //(4)
		energy          sensibleEnthalpy;              //(7)
		equationOfState soaveRedlichKwong;             //(5)
		specie          rfSpecie;                      //(6)
	}

In the _constant/chemistryProperties_ file: 

	chemistryType
	{
		solver   ode;                                  // either ode/EulerImplicit/none;
		method   SRKchungTakaStandard;                 //(8)
	}

There are 20 options (combinations) are available for reacting flow simulations in the library as follows:

| No | type(1)| mixture(2) | transport(3) | thermo(4) | EoS(5) | specie(6) | Energy(7) | method(8)      |

## Installation
- Since the new library is developed based on OpenFOAM 6.0 in Linux operating systems, the complete installation of OpenFOAM 6.0 framework is required. 
- Prepare a directory on your system, e.g., _yourDirectory_:

		mkdir ~/OpenFOAM/yourDirectory/
		cd ~/OpenFOAM/yourDirectory/	
- Download source files using git: 

		git clone https://github.com/danhnam11/realFluidThermophysicalModels-6.git

- Specify the path of your _src_ directory to an environment variable, _LIB_REALFLUID_SRC_. For example:

		echo "export LIB_REALFLUID_SRC=~/OpenFOAM/yourDirectory/realFluidThermophysicalModels-6/src/" >> ~/.bashrc
		source ~/.bashrc
- To compile the library and applications, go to _realFluidThermophysicalModels_ directory and run the _Allwmake_ script:

		cd ~/OpenFOAM/yourDirectory/realFluidThermophysicalModels-6/
		./Allwmake

- Now the real-fluid based _thermophysicalModels_ library and _realFluidReactingFoam_ solver are ready to use. The library and solver are stored at _$FOAM_USER_LIBBIN_ and _$FOAM_USER_APPBIN_ directory.

## Using real-fluid models in a solver 
- See _implementationGuide.pdf_ file in documentations.
- Applications of interest that adopt _thermophysicalModels_, _combustionModels_, _compressibleTurbulenceModels_ libraries should be recompiled with a proper path linking to the new ones to avoid a _segmentation fault_ error since new created object files of those libraries have been replaced to the original ones in OpenFOAM.
- A function returing mass diffusivity has not been implemented yet for rho-based system.
- Readers are referred to our paper for the validation of the new library.

## Tutorials
Tutorials for generating thermodynamic and transport properties of a pure species, mixture and for laminar non-premixed counterflow flames of CH4 versus O2/CO2 are available in _tutorial_ directory.
